Void catalogs: Gigantes includes 15,000 VIDE fiducial cosmology void catalogs, as well as over 9,000 catalogs in non-fiducial cosmologies, spanning various values of the following cosmological parameters  :math:`\Omega_\mathrm{m}`[add] and fully leveraging the QUIJOTE simulation suite, which covers redshifts z = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 in real- and redshift-space.

Void finder: The void finding relies on the popular public void finder VIDE (Sutter et al. 2015b), arguably the most used void finder, as testified by its use in a plethora of papers performing both simulation-based theoretical modelling and data analysis from modern surveys
