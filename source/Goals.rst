Goals
====================================
We present GIGANTES, the most extensive and realistic void catalog suite ever released—containing over 1 billion cosmic voids covering a volume larger than the observable Universe, more than 20 TB of data, and created by running the void finder VIDE on QUIJOTE’s halo simulations. 

By providing this large dataset we aim to provide the tools for intensive machine learning exploration of void statistics.
