Description
===========

Void catalogs: Gigantes includes 15,000 VIDE fiducial cosmology void catalogs, as well as over 9,000 catalogs in non-fiducial cosmologies, spanning various values of the following cosmological parameters :math:`\Omega_{\rm m}`, :math:`\Omega_{\rm b}`, :math:`h`, :math:`n_s`, :math:`\sigma_8`, :math:`M_\nu`, and fully leveraging the QUIJOTE simulation suite, which covers redshifts z = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2 in real- and redshift-space.


Void finder: The void finding relies on the popular public void finder VIDE (`Sutter et al. 2015b<https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1191>`__), arguably the most used void finder, as testified by its use in a plethora of papers performing both simulation-based theoretical modelling and data analysis from modern surveys (`Papers using VIDE<http://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Papers%20Using%20VIDE>`__).

Information about VIDE, used to build GIGANTES can be found here : `VIDE Wiki<https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Home>`__ .
