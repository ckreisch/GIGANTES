Applications
============

Application 1: cosmological information in void statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We aim to answer the following question: Do voids carry additional information? 
The question of whether voids, defined by relying on the halo (or galaxy) distribution, carry additional cosmological information with respect to traditional tools based on the halo (or galaxy) distribution, such as the two-point correlation function or the halo-mass function, has been a debated topic.
Relying on a Fisher forecast from the GIGANTES dataset we show that void statistics allow to constrain regions of the parameter space that would otherwise remain unconstrained. 

Application 2: likelihood-free inference on the void size function 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Application 3: void finder sensitivity to shape adds information 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
