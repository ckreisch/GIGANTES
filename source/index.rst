Gigantes
====================================
Gigantes is the most extensive and realistic void catalog suite ever released, containing over 1 billion cosmic voids covering a volume larger than the observable Universe, more than 20 TB of data, and created by running the void finder VIDE on the halos from the `Quijote simulations <https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. 
Gigantes provides the tools for intensive machine learning exploration of void statistics.
